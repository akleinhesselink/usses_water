Dr. Buckley,

Thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript.
All three reviewers agree our paper is interesting, but point out several areas where we could improve the analysis.
We were impressed with the very constructive reviews, and thank the reviewers for taking such care when reading our paper.
We hope our paper is now suitable for publication in \emph{PeerJ}.

In our point-by-point response below, the original reviews are in black and \response{our responses are in blue.} 
Likewise, changes made in the manuscript text are \response{in blue} for clarity.
In our responses, we refer to line numbers of the revised manuscript unless otherwise stated.
